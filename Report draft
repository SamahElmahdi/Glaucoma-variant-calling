Variant Calling for Primary Closed Angle Glaucoma
Introduction:
Glaucoma considers as the second leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide.Primary angle-closure glaucoma is a complex heterogeneous disease, with the genetic susceptibility under investigation.Due to the high prevalence among Inuits and Asians compared to Caucasians, suggesting a genetic predisposition for the disorder.
Also an unusually high incidence of PACG among siblings of affected patients, it was suggested that genetic factors were involved in its pathology and the action of a large number of grouped or independently inherited genes along with environmental factors result in anatomical abnormalities of PACG
Since PACG has become an important target for association studies.There are 3 genome-wide association studies for PACG. A genome-wide association study for PACG in an Asian cohort identified 3 loci associated with PACG.Expanded genome-wide association study, and replication study of PACG has identified 5 new susceptibility,thus bringing the total number of replicated loci to 8. 
For our project we have used the reads from bioproject( Accession:PRJNA394051)for studing the Homo sapiens gemonics of Glaucoma the study was performed to identify the possible candidate gene variations involved in glaucoma pathology.
They had sequenced both familial and singlet samples for the study.

Five samples taken from Peripheral blood represent the whole exome for each were selected for our pilote study.Three female patient samples (SRR5858157: SRR5858162: SRR5858204), and two male control samples (SRR5858160: SRR5858161) with the age of 45,53,47,44,48 respectively
All samples were provided by CSIR-IGIB, Mathura Road, New Delhi biomaterial provider.

Methods:
1. SRAtoolkit was used to sup set only 8 milion  paired end reads for each sample and split each into two fastq files for read1 and read2. Only 8 milion  paired end reads were sup seted to acheive about 46X coverage of the whole exome; which length is about 1.1% of the total genome, or about 30 megabases of DNA and our reads are 93*2, that is due to our limited computational resources. 
2. FASTQC for each sample to estimate its quality and no trimming was needed.
3.Variant discovery in our sequencing data was done by Genome Analysis Toolkit(GATK) pipline.
3.1.Adding read group information (to identify which read group each read belongs to),followed by alignment step.
3.2. A fast spliced aware aligner with law memory requirment (Hisat2) was selected as we have an exome reads.
3.3. Chromosome 20 was choosen as a reference according to literatures which defined the chromosomes that have gene mutations for PCAG, also it`s the smallest one in size as our computitional resources was limited.
3.4. The reference chromosome 20 was downloaded from "ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-99/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome.20.fa.gz", while the whole annotated genome was downloaded from "ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-99/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.99.chr.gtf.gz", then Chromosome 20 annotation was Extracted from the whole annotated genome.  
3.5.Hisat2 installation and the reference indexing "Chromosome 20" was done.
3.6.The Alignment results showed about 2.82% alignment rate which was very low rate than expected.
4...To overcome this law alignment rate , we change our plan and decided to use the whole genome as areference to our samples and we start again the steps.
4.1.The whole genome reference was downloaded from:wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-99/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz while the whole annotated genome was downloaded before.
4.2.At the indexing step of reference whole genome ,we stopped due to disk space issues and our pcs were crached,so we have to change our plan and start again.
5...we choose a fewer number of chromosomes (3-6-11-20) and merge them toghther as areference to align in. 
5.1.The reference chromosomes (3-6-11-20) were downloaded,wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-99/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome.3.fa.gz,wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-99/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome.6.fa.gz,wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-99/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome.11.fa.gz,wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-99/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome.20.fa.gz
5.2.The chromosomes files of (3-6-11-20) were concatinated in one file to be used as areference.
5.3.The annotated chromosomes (3-6-11-20) were selected from the whole annotated genome. 
5.4.The indexing step takes more than 8hours and finally, Memory dump occured (Ran out of memory; automatically trying more memory-economical parameters).!!,so we try another plan and start again.
6...to improve alignment rate,another chromosome (chromosome 11)was used as areference,we downloaded it .but indexing takes over 8 hours and finally not completed files , the number of indexed files are 6 files instead of 9 files,so we try another trail.
7...Hawever,we know that  using whole genome as a reference is better than using coding sequence as a reference to avoid loss of important data in flanking regions , but doing this trial to avoid high computational resources requirements for downstream analysis in case of using whole genome as a reference.
7.1.The Index of /pub/CCDS/current_human was downloaded,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/CCDS/current_human,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/CCDS/current_human/CCDS_nucleotide.current.fna.gz
7.2.Pwa (splice non -aware alighnmer),but the produced sam files contains only headers, so we return to the first trail of using chromosome 20 as areference(in spite of it`s law rate of alignment) and continue the GATK pipline. 
3.7.Sam tools was used to convert sam(sequence alignment format) files into it`s compressed binary format bam  files  and sort them  
3.8.mapping QC also was done using sam tools ,the resulted stat file was checked.
3.9.Picard tools were used to mark duplicates in each sample bam sorted file as the same fragment may be read twice so we have mark these duplicates.
3.10.installing Genome Analysis Toolkit(GATK),followed by indexing step of both the samples and the chromosome 20 reference genome.
3.11.Download and index known polymorphic sites(Known Variants),to be used to mask out bases at sites of expected (known) variation, to avoid counting real variants as errors, any other mismatch will be counted as an error,wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-99/variation/vcf/homo_sapiens/homo_sapiens-chr20.vcf.gz.
3.12.Recalibration process of the bases was done in two steps, the first one by (BaseRecalibrator) tool which builds a model of covariation based on the data and a set of known variants, the second one is (ApplyBQSR) tool that adjusts the quality scores of bases in the data based on the resulted model of the first step.













Picard tools have the ability to modify IDs when merging SAM files in order to avoid collisions.
After alignent step, we would use the GATK for the variant calling and joint variant calling using HaplotypeCaller. needed resources like the known PACG variants for the chosen chromosome would be used. The final expected results would be the PACG SNPs and indels.
Due to our limited resources, we expect that we may face some technical issues and the results may not be accurate enough.
