***download 15 million reads for PCAG sample  (SRR5858157) R1&R2) by using the fastq dump
fastq-dump -X 15000000 -Z SRR5858157 |fastq-dump -I --split-files SRR5858157 (wrong command.... make spliting to all reads not 15 milloin)
*****the right one is******* 
fastq-dump -I --split-files -X 8000000 SRR5858157
******  the reads was chosen to be 8 million reads- the read lenght 93 
93*2= 186 * 8 million = 1488 million / 300 million (whole exome)= 4.98 approx.= 5x  ******

*****#Fastqc for the two read sequences*****
for f in ~/workdir/Glaucomaproject/*.fastq.gz;do fastqc -t 1 -f fastq -noextract $f;done
the results showed that Sequences flagged as poor quality are zero, all qc were very good
No need for trimming.

*****alignement****
for alignement with 
hisat2 we need reference chromosome (chromosome 20 was chosen)and
downloaded from NCBI https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AF312915.1
also we need annotated chromosome 20
