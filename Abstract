a pilot study would be performed to identify the possible genetic variants that involved in Angle Closure Glaucoma (PACG) pathology.
3 samples and 2 controls from "Exome-Seq of homo sapiens: PACG" would be selected as SRA datatype from NCBI https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?linkname=bioproject_sra_all&from_uid=394051.
each member of our team would sup set 8 million paired end reads to acheive about 5 X coverage of the whole exome due to our limited computational resources.
the quality of the data would be tested by FastQC then the data would be trimmed if needed.
the alignment step would be performed by an appropriate aligner.
