Variant Calling for Primary Closed Angle Glaucoma
Introduction:
Glaucoma considers as the second leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide.Primary angle-closure glaucoma is a complex heterogeneous disease, with the genetic susceptibility under investigation.Due to the high prevalence among Inuits and Asians compared to Caucasians, suggesting a genetic predisposition for the disorder.
Also an unusually high incidence of PACG among siblings of affected patients, it was suggested that genetic factors were involved in its pathology and the action of a large number of grouped or independently inherited genes along with environmental factors result in anatomical abnormalities of PACG
Since PACG has become an important target for association studies.There are 3 genome-wide association studies for PACG. A genome-wide association study for PACG in an Asian cohort identified 3 loci associated with PACG.Expanded genome-wide association study, and replication study of PACG has identified 5 new susceptibility,thus bringing the total number of replicated loci to 8 


For our project we have used the reads from bioproject( Accession:PRJNA394051)for studing the Homo sapiens gemonics of Glaucoma the study was performed to identify the possible candidate gene variations involved in glaucoma pathology.
They had sequenced both familial and singlet samples for the study.

Five samples taken from Peripheral blood represent the whole exome for each were selected for our pilote study.Three female patient samples (SRR5858157: SRR5858162: SRR5858204), and two male control samples (SRR5858160: SRR5858161) with the age of 45,53,47,44,48 respectively
All samples were provided by 	CSIR-IGIB, Mathura Road, New Delhi biomaterial provider.

Methods:
SRAtoolkit was used to sup set only 8 milion  paired end reads for each sample and split each into two fastq files for read1 and read2.
Only 8 milion  paired end reads were sup seted to acheive about 46X coverage of the whole exome; which length is about 1.1% of the total genome, or about 30 megabases of DNA and our reads are 93*2, that is due to our limited computational resources. 
FASTQC for each read end to know if the triming step is essentil or can be skipped
Chromosome 20 was choosen as areference according to literatures which defined the chromosomes that have gene mutations for PCAG, also it`s the smallest one in size due to our limited computitional resources.
Downloading the reference chromosome 20:wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-99/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome.20.fa.gz
Downloading the whole annotated genome:wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-99/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.99.chr.gtf.gz
Extracting the annotated Chromosome 20 from the whole annotated genome.  
Afast spliced aware aligner with law memory requirment (Hisat2) was selected as we have an exome reads,the first step was the installation of Hisat2 followed by the indexing step to index reference genome of chromosome 20

Alignment step with chromosome 20 only as areference,then the Alignment summary was checked the resulted overall alignment rate was 2.65% .
Adding read group information (to identify which read group each read belongs to),then alignment with HISAT2 was repeated. 
Sam files were converted into bam files and sorted 














Picard tools have the ability to modify IDs when merging SAM files in order to avoid collisions.
After alignent step, we would use the GATK for the variant calling and joint variant calling using HaplotypeCaller. needed resources like the known PACG variants for the chosen chromosome would be used. The final expected results would be the PACG SNPs and indels.
Due to our limited resources, we expect that we may face some technical issues and the results may not be accurate enough.
