Glaucoma is the second leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. It is a group of heterogeneous optic neuropathies and affects approximately 70 million individuals worldwide.
It is a heterogeneous group of optic neuropathies, all types are characterized by progressive and irreversible destruction of optic nerve and degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs).
The number of people with glaucoma (primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) combined) worldwide was estimated to be around 60.5 million in 2010. This number will increase significantly in the future, and it has been estimated that by 2020, approximately 79.6 million people will be affected, including 3 million in the USA.According to recent studies, the number of people affected by glaucoma worldwide will reach 111.8 million by 2040, with Africa and Asia being most heavily affected.Chinese patients with PACG account for nearly half of PACG cases worldwide.
Primary angle-closure glaucoma is a complex heterogeneous disease, with the genetic susceptibility under investigation.Due to the high prevalence among Inuits and Asians compared to Caucasians, suggesting a genetic predisposition for the disorder.
Also an unusually high incidence of PACG among siblings of affected patients, it was suggested that genetic factors were involved in its pathology and the action of a large number of grouped or independently inherited genes along with environmental factors result in anatomical abnormalities of PACG
since PACG has become an important target for association studies (Shastry, 2013). There are 3 genome-wide association studies for PACG. A genome-wide association study for PACG in an Asian cohort identified 3 loci associated with PACG. These loci are located on COL11A1 rs3753841, PLEKHA7 rs11024102, and located between PCMTD1 and ST18 rs1015213. Expanded genome-wide association study, and replication study of PACG has identified 5 new susceptibility loci (EPDR1 rs3816415, CHAT rs1258267, GLIS3 rs736893, FERMT2 rs7494379, and DPM2eFAM102 A rs3739821, thus bringing the total number of replicated loci to 8 (Zhang et al., 2017)
